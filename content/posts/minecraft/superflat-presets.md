Here is a list of superflat presets that I like to use

Here is a preset for the Redstone Ready world type to use grass as the top layer, and be a plains biome
Well, this one only creates it with grass for 116 layers, I will change it to be dirt and stone for some layers.
minecraft:bedrock,3*minecraft:stone,116*minecraft:grass_block;minecraft:plains

Here is a good website to generate flat world presets: [https://minecraft.tools/en/flat.php](https://minecraft.tools/en/flat.php)

List of presets generated from that site:

    1 grass layer, 30 layers of dirt, 30 layers of stone, and 3 layers of bedrock
